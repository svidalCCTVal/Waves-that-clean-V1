# Waves-that-clean-V1

 This repository contains de Firmware for the first prototype of a Solar Panel Cleaner Robot. It's based on Arduino Nano, programed with PlatformIO framework. 

 ### Some trouble shootings 

 1. Depending when and to whom you buy an Arduino Nano, the bootloader can change. Refer to the file platofrmio.ini and change the parameter board = nanoatmega328 to board = nanoatmega328new, or viceversa.
